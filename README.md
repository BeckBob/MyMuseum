## About

MyMuseum is a website that gathers artwork from the Metropolion Museum and The Harvard Art Museum. Users can browse and search artworks, and then later add artwork to their own personal exhibition which can be viewed on the my exhibition page.

Deployed app can be found here - https://mymuseumapp-kc4wtowo.b4a.run/. Hosted using back4app at https://containers.back4app.com/apps.

Created using Harvards API and The Metropoliton Museums API. Each API uses different keys for the same types of information, for instance to get the date of the piece The Metropolitan Museum stores it under the key ObjectDate and Harvard used Dated, be mindful of this.
